# Our Networks: Visiting

## Visiting Toronto

Our Networks provides a guide to those visiting Toronto that covers transportation and accomodation. Organizers facilitate a **community billeting** program that aims to match conference participants to local community hosts.

## Travel visa

Conference participants from some countries may need to apply for a Canadian travel visa to enter the country. The application process requires Our Networks organizers to issue an invitation letter. A PDF letter can be generated using our [travel-visa-letter](https://github.com/ournetworks/2019/tree/master/visas) generator after obtaining personal information from the applicant. It is important that the personal information is communicated over an encrypted channel agreed to by both parties, and that the data is deleted from organizer computers after the visa process is completed.
