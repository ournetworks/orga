# Our Networks: Finances

Our Networks uses [Alterna](https://www.alterna.ca) as the main provider for financial services.

## Invoices

Invoices are created using [invoice-generator.com](https://invoice-generator.com). You can find invoice template examples in our [2019](https://github.com/ournetworks/2019/tree/master/sponsorships) and [2018](https://github.com/ournetworks/2018/tree/master/sponsorships) planning repositories.

## Transfers

**Receiving e-transfers** require sending the transfer to `orga@ournetworks.ca` for record keeping.

**Receiving wire transfers** require attaching the appropriate wire form to the invoice, which depends on the country of the origin financial institution and the currencies involved. You can find the forms in the `alterna-wires` folder on our [Mayfirst Nextcloud](https://share.mayfirst.org).

**Sending e-transfers** require two signatures from organizers who are registered with the financial institution.

**Sending wire transfers** require going to the Alterna branch in person to set it up.

We do not usually keep a balance on our Paypal, but we can also send and receive money from our Paypal account if necessary.
